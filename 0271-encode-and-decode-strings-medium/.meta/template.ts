/**
 * String Encode and Decode - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-decode
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. 
 * The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]
 * Output: ["neet","code","love","you"]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
 * Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 0 <= strs.length < 100
 * - 0 <= strs[i].length < 200
 * - strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.
